# Non-MaxwellianDistribution
## Overview

In astronomical environments, the high-temperature emission of plasma mainly depends on ion charge states, which requires accurate analysis of the ionization and recombination processes. For various phenomena involving energetic particles, the non-Maxwellian distributions of electrons exhibiting high-energy tails can significantly enhance the ionization process.
Accurately computing ionization and recombination rates with non-Maxwellian electron distributions is therefore essential for emission diagnostic analysis.

## Purpose

This repository presents two methods for fitting various non-Maxwellian distributions using the **Maxwellian decomposition strategy**. These methods aim to improve the accuracy of ionization and recombination rate calculations, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical plasmas.

## Features

- Supports modeling of non-Maxwellian electron energy distributions
- Implements Maxwellian decomposition for rate calculations
- Enhances diagnostics for high-energy plasma emissions

## Usage

You can use this code to:

- Fit non-Maxwellian distributions with Maxwellian components
- Compute ionization and recombination rates for astrophysical diagnostics
